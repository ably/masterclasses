# Ably Masterclasses - Episode 1 

## Building a realtime voting app in less than an hour

In this masterclass, Ablyâ€™s Developer Advocate, [Srushtika Neelakantam](https://www.twitter.com/Srushtika), spoke about realtime protocols and the various cool things you can do with them.

She then built a voting app from scratch that is production-ready and fully scalable. The app will show a dynamically changing graph reflecting the choices made by users on the voting questions, in realtime. Just some basic JavaScript knowledge is required to follow along.

Feel free to reach out to Srushtika via [devrel@ably.io](mailto:devrel@ably.io) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Srushtika) to ask her any questions you may have.
